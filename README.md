This is my Kanban board for this project.
 This project is divided into 7 milestones with specific due dates and includes 32 user stories.

The Kanban board is an essential tool for tracking progress and ensuring efficient project management. It is organized into several columns: To Do, In Progress, Done, Bugs, Future Features, and Won’t Have.

  * To Do: Tasks that are planned and ready to be worked on.
  * In Progress: Tasks that are currently being worked on.
  *	Done: Completed tasks.
  * Bugs: Identified issues that need to be fixed.
  * Future Features: Ideas and features planned for future implementation.
  * Won’t Have: Tasks and features that have been decided against including.

Using the Kanban board helps maintain a clear overview of the project, ensuring that all tasks are accounted for and that progress is visible at a glance. This method enhances organization, prioritization, and efficiency.

I find the Kanban board invaluable for staying on track and look forward to exploring and learning more about Kanban in the future!
